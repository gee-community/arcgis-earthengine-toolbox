# arcgis-earthengine-toolbox
An ArcGIS Pro toolbox for connection to Google Earth Engine

A set of open source Python scripts that wrap functionality of the Python GEE API, that can be added to ArcGIS Pro desktop application as a Python toolbox. These scripts would present simple GUIs to users of ArcGIS Pro that would help them to: 
* Connect to GEE for data visualization and limited processing within the ArcGIS Pro application
* Access data from the GEE data catalog, and GEE assets from their Google Cloud Platform projects for use in their ArcGIS projects
* Upload data from ArcGIS Pro to Google Cloud Storage and GEE assets
* Run Python scripts calling GEE from ArcGIS pro 
* Include GEE operations in model builder

This toolbox was developed in partnership with [Woolpert Digital Innovations](http://innovations.woolpert.com)
