# ArcGIS Earth Engine Toolbox (GEE Connector) User Guide: Introduction
Welcome to the ArcGIS-EarthEngine Toolbox!
This section will describe the basic concepts, and prequisites to use the ArcGIS-EarthEngine Connector toolbox within ArcGIS Pro. 

This user guide provides instructions for using the ArcGIS Earth Engine Toolbox, a Python toolbox that allows users to interact with Google Earth Engine (GEE) from ArcGIS Pro. The toolbox provides a set of tools for managing Earth Engine assets, downloading and uploading data, and processing data using Earth Engine's API. Please see the individual toolbox descriptions in the documents pages for specifics on each tool.

## Prerequisites

Before using the ArcGIS Earth Engine Toolbox, ensure you have the following:

1. ArcGIS Pro 3.2 or later installed on your computer.
2. Google Earth Engine API enabled for your Google Cloud project. See [this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/earth-engine) for Google Cloud Project creation & registration with Earth Engine.
3. Google Cloud SDK installed on your computer.

For more detailed information see the [installation page](03_installation.md) in the documentation.

## Key Concepts Overview

### Google Earth Engine

[Google Earth Engine](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine) (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that provides access to a wide range of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It allows users to perform complex geospatial analysis and visualization tasks using a wide range of Earth observation data.

### Google Cloud Project

A Google Cloud project is a container for resources and services in Google Cloud. Each project has a unique ID and is associated with a billing account.

To find your project ID, go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), click on the project dropdown menu in the top left corner, and select "Project info". The project ID is displayed in the "Project ID" field.

If you do not have a Google Cloud project, please see [this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/earth-engine) for a guided flow to create a project, or register an existing project with Earth Engine.

### Workload Tag

Workload tags are labels for monitoring specific computations within Earth Engine. The user can monitor and track tagged computations in the Metrics Explorer using the Earth Engine Cloud Project > Project > Used EECUs metric, and grouping or filtering by workload_tag. Refer to [this link](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/monitoring_usage) for more information.

**Workload tag must be 1 - 63 characters, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alpha numerics between, or an empty string to reset the default back to none.**


### Google Cloud SDK

The [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools and libraries designed to interact with Google Cloud services. It provides the core tools necessary for managing resources and services on Google Cloud.

Key components include:

- gcloud CLI: A command-line tool to manage Google Cloud resources (e.g., deploying applications, managing Kubernetes clusters, configuring services, etc.).
- gsutil: A command-line tool for working with Google Cloud Storage (e.g., uploading, downloading, and managing storage buckets and objects).
- bq: A command-line tool for interacting with BigQuery.
- Libraries and APIs: Programming tools to help developers integrate with Google Cloud.

### Google Cloud SDK Shell

The Google Cloud SDK Shell (specific to Windows) is a pre-configured command-line shell that comes with the Google Cloud SDK installation for Windows users. It provides:

- A command-line environment with all the tools from the Google Cloud SDK ready to use.
- A pre-configured path for Google Cloud SDK binaries, so users donâ€™t have to configure environment variables manually.
- Windows-specific convenience: It simplifies setup and usage, especially for users who are less comfortable with configuring standard shells like PowerShell or Command Prompt.

### ArcGIS Python Toolbox

An [ArcGIS Python Toolbox](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/geoprocessing_and_python/a-quick-tour-of-python-toolboxes.htm) (.pyt) is a specialized type of toolbox in the ArcGIS platform, created using Python. It allows users to develop and integrate geoprocessing tools and workflows directly into ArcGIS using Python scripting. 

An ArcGIS Python Toolbox (created as a .pyt file) does not inherently include a custom-designed graphical user interface (GUI). Instead, its GUI is dynamically generated by ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap's **Geoprocessing Pane** or **Toolbox Window**. When a Python toolbox is added to ArcGIS, its tools appear as menu items, and selecting a tool opens a standard ArcGIS geoprocessing dialog box where users can interact with the tool's parameters.

The GUI for tools in a Python toolbox includes:

1. Tool Name and Description:

The top of the dialog box displays the tool's name and an optional description that the user can define in the Python script.

2. Parameter Input Fields and Description:

Input field types depend on the parameter data type, such as:
- Dropdowns for choices.
- File or layer pickers for datasets.
- Textboxes for string or numeric inputs.
- **Required parameters are marked with a red asterisk.**
- **Input parameters without a red asterisk are optional.**

Each parameter has a description that the user can define in the Python script.

3. Messages Section:

A section displays any messages generated during execution, such as progress updates, warnings, or errors. **The user can click "View Details" at the bottom of the script to view the full message during or after execution.**

4. Environment Settings:

Users can modify environment settings like processing extents, output coordinate systems, and cell sizes through an additional expandable menu. **Environment settings are unnecessary for the ArcGIS Earth Engine Toolbox.**
