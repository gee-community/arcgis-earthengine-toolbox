# ArcGEE Connector
An ArcPro Python toolbox for connection to Google Earth Engine (GEE)

## Introduction 
ArcGEE is a Python toolbox for ArcGIS that seamlessly connects the Google Earth Engine API with ArcPro. This integration empowers users to explore, download, analyze, and visualize an extensive repository of Google Earth Engine datasets directly within ArcPro, while also enabling the upload of local datasets to Google Earth Engine assets. By leveraging Google Earth Engineâ€™s scalable computing power and advanced machine learning models, ArcGEE provides a powerful, no-code solution for big data analytics, combining the strengths of both platforms for an enhanced, efficient workflow.
